Added aditional features where the menu items that are added are displayed along with the price on the home screen. Added a whole seperate page where the user can filter which course of the meal they would like a seprate page was also added where the user can remove items from the menu. The homepage now has realtime updates where if something is added or removed it will be updated on the home screen aswell as the average prace for each dish. The fiebase authentication remains the same as the last project as well as the live splash screens.
